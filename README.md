# rbd-voice-sensor
A voice sensor for [react-beautiful-dnd](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd), built with the [Web Speech API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API) 

*What are sensors?*
A sensor is a React Hook (or plain ol' function) that gives you access to [RBD's Programmatic API](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd/blob/virtual/docs/sensors/programmatic.md), with that API you're able to programmatically control drag and drop interactions with any input type you can think of.
